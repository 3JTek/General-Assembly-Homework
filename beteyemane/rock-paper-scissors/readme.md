### Requirements

* When a user makes their choice (rock, paper or scissors), you should also randomly generate a computer choice
* Write some logic to determine who has won
* Display the player's choice and the computer's choice
* Display the winner on the page
* Clear the choices and the winner from the screen if the user presses a reset button


**Note:** Remember to wrap your code in a `DOMContentLoaded` event listener.
