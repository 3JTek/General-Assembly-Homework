# Python TDD Functions Lab 101

In the starter code you have a file containing a number of tests, and a file with a series of problems to solve:

```bash
starter-code
├── problems_test.py
└── problems.py
```

To run the tests simply run `python problems_test.py` in the terminal

Write your solutions in the `problems.py` file. To check your progress, simply re run the command above.

To un-skip a test delete the `@unittest.skip` line above the test in the `problems_test.py` file.
To skip a test add `@unittest.skip` above the test.

## Tips
- Use `print` to help you experiment as you work.
- Work through the problems one at a time.
- You are not expected to complete all the problems.
- If you've been struggling with a problem for a while, `skip` it and move on to the next one.
- Feel free to work with a friend or colleague.
- Don't be afraid to ask for help.
- Once you are finished, take a look through the `problems_test.py` file to become more acquainted with what automated tests look like.
