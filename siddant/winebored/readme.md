# Winebored Authentication Lab

Again, there are a lot of moving parts with Authentication: tokens, forms, state, localStorage, it's all going on. Time for a recap.

## Requirements

Building on your homework from the night before, add the following:

* An `Auth` class that can be used to store and retrieve tokens
* A register page
* A login page
* A NEW page for creating wines

## Tips

* Do not just copy and paste the work you have done today. This homework is about understanding not only the syntax, but also the way that all the different parts of the app fit together.
* Do not just copy each file from top to bottom, as you will import components that you have not yet built, which will cause bugs.
* Think about the order in which to build things, make sure you are creating your components in a logical and pragmatic way.
* Favour creating larger components to check that things are working correctly _before_ splitting them into smaller components.

## Bonus

* Add an EDIT page for modifying existing wines
* Round out the app with a DELETE button on the SHOW page, which deletes the wine and redirects to the INDEX page
