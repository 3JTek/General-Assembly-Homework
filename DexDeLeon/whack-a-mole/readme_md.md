## Whack-a-Mole

### Introduction

Your task is to create the classic children's game Whack-a-Mole using HTML, CSS and JavaScript!

### Requirements

* Create a grid of squares
* A "mole" should randomly appear in a square every 1000 ms for 750 ms
* If the user clicks on the square containing the "mole" they should get a point
* The game should run for 60 seconds


**Note:** Remember to wrap your code in a `DOMContentLoaded` event listener.

### Bonus

* Make a start game button which displays on page load, then disappears when the game starts
* Make an end game screen which displays the users score and displays the start game button again
* Clicking on the start button would reset the score, timer and start the game again

### Bonus bonus

* Make the game mobile responsive
* Add different levels (more squares, faster moles, less time etc)
* Add sounds
* Add CSS animations (hint: check out [Aminate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/))
