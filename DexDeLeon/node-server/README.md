# Node Server homework

There is a lot of new information, so take your time and build it up piece by piece. **Don't spend too much time deciding what resource to use!**

## Requirements

Set up a Mongo database and server to do the following:

* Create a schema of your choosing (films, chairs, pok√©mon etc)
* Set up a Create Route
* Set up an Index Route

## Tips

* Refer to the work you did today, but do not just copy and paste. This homework is about understanding what each block is doing and how to build a basic server from the ground up.
* Make sure mongod is running!

## Bonus

* Try making a show route
* Buy your TAs chocolate
