# SCSS Lab

### Introduction

In order to practice writing SCSS, take the starter code provided and attempt to build out the website shown below. The screenshot shows the layout of the finished styled website. You should also take this opportunity to practice your Flexbox chops.

You will find the images inside the `images` directory. When you are adding the `src` attribute to the `<img>` tags, you will need to prefix the name of the file with `images/`.

**Note:** There are 2 forms on the page, one for the search and one for the email subscription. These both have submit buttons, that are styled in slightly different ways. When you are marking up your forms, remember to add the submit buttons.
