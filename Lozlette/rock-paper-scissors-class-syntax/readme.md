## Rock, Paper, Scissors (Class Syntax)

### Introduction

Taking the starter code provided, refactor the code to use the new ES6 `class` syntax

### Requirements

* All the logic should be contained within a `RPS` class
* You should create a `new` instance of `RPS` when the `DOMContentLoaded` fires
* Do NOT attempt to generate HTML in your JavaScript. Instead get your elements from the DOM in the `constructor` method

### Bonus

* Once you have completed the task, try to generate the `rock`, `paper`, `scissors` buttons in the constructor and add them to the DOM.

### Tips

* Make sure you follow the same structure outlined in class today
* Make sure you commit your code before attempting the bonus challenge
