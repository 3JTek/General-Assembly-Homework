# BBC Sport Responsive Site

## Introduction

> This exercise is for you to practice building responsive layouts using a CSS framework. We're going to use Bulma - a nice, CSS-only (no JavaScript) framework based on flexbox.

Your task is to replicate BBC Sport's responsive layout with Bulma. [Look at the website here](www.bbc.com/sport) and play with the width of the window to see what you need to do.

## Instructions

* Use the starter code provided and replicate the BBC Sport website's responsive layout.
* Use Bulma's column classes to create the layout, see the [documentation](https://bulma.io/) for information on how these work.
* Try to create the design using just the Bulma classes and only write your own CSS to add some final touches.
* You don't have to do the entire page! See below for the deliverable. Good luck!
